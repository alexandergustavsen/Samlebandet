A declarative cross-platform react-native datetime-picker.

## Description

This library exposes a cross-platform interface for showing the native date-picker and time-picker inside a modal.
You will have an unified user experience, you won't have to worry anymore about testing the device platform and you won't have to programmatically call the Android TimePicker/DatePicker APIs.

## Setup

This library is available on npm, install it with `npm install --save react-native-modal-datetime-picker` or `yarn add react-native-modal-datetime-picker`.

## Usage

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';
import DateTimePicker from 'react-native-modal-datetime-picker';

export default class DateTimePickerTester extends Component {
  state = {
    isDateTimePickerVisible: false,
  };

  _showDateTimePicker = () => this.setState({ isDateTimePickerVisible: true });

  _hideDateTimePicker = () => this.setState({ isDateTimePickerVisible: false });

  _handleDatePicked = (date) => {
    console.log('A date has been picked: ', date);
    this._hideDateTimePicker();
  };

  render () {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._showDateTimePicker}>
          <Text>Show DatePicker</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <DateTimePicker
          isVisible={this.state.isDateTimePickerVisible}
          onConfirm={this._handleDatePicked}

## Frequently Asked Questions

### The component is not working as expected
Under the hood `react-native-modal-datetime-picker` uses react-native original [DatePickerAndroid](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/datepickerandroid.html), [TimePickerAndroid](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/timepickerandroid.html) and [DatePickerIOS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/datepickerios.html).
Before reporting a bug, try swapping `react-native-datetime-picker` with react-native original date/time pickers and, if the issue persists, check if it has already been reported as a [react-native issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues).

### How can I show the timepicker instead of the datepicker?
Just set the `mode` prop to `time`.
You can also display both the datepicker and the timepicker in one step by setting the `mode` prop to `datetime`.

### Why is the selected start date being shown in the input field of the end date?
If you have both a start date/time and end date/time picker on the same screen, you will need to have `showDateTimePicker`, `hideDateTimePicker`, and `handleDatePicked` functions for both.

```javascript
showStartDateTimePicker = () => this.setState({ startDateTimePickerVisible: true });

showEndDateTimePicker = () => this.setState({ endDateTimePickerVisible: true });

hideStartDateTimePicker = () => this.setState({ startDateTimePickerVisible: false });

hideEndDateTimePicker = () => this.setState({ endDateTimePickerVisible: false });

handleStartDatePicked = (date) => {
  console.log('A date has been picked: ', date);
  this.hideStartDateTimePicker();
};

handleEndDatePicked = (date) => {
  console.log('A date has been picked: ', date);
  this.hideEndDateTimePicker();
};
```

### How do I change the color of the Android date and time pickers?  
This is more a React-Native specific question than a react-native-modal-datetime-picker one.  
See issue [#29](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues/29) and [#106](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues/106) for some solutions.  

### How to set 24 hours in iOS ?
The `is24Hour` prop is only available on Android but you use a small hack for enabling it on iOS by setting the app's default timezone as `en_GB`.
To do so, edit your `AppDelegate.m` file, and add `[[UIDatePicker appearance] setLocale:[[NSLocale alloc]initWithLocaleIdentifier:@"en_GB"]];` to `application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`

## Notes
Remember to always set the `isVisible` prop to `false` in both the `onConfirm` and `onCancel` props (like in the example above).

Under the hood this library is using [react-native-modal](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal) for the iOS modal implementation.
