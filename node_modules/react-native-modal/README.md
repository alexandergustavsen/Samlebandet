An enhanced, animated and customizable react-native modal.  
  
The aim of `react-native-modal` is expanding the original react-native `Modal` component by adding animations and styles customization options while still providing a plain-simple API.

## Features

* Smooth enter/exit animations
* Plain simple and flexible APIs
* Customizable backdrop opacity, color and timing
* Listeners for the modal animations ending
* Resize itself correctly on device rotation
* Swipeable
* Scrollable

## Setup

This library is available on npm, install it with: `npm install --save react-native-modal` or `yarn add react-native-modal`.

## Usage

Since react-native-modal is an extension of the original react native modal, it works in a similar fashion [react-native original modal](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/modal.html).

1. Import react-native-modal:

```javascript
import Modal from "react-native-modal";
```

2. Create a modal and nest its content inside of it:

```javascript
render () {
    return (
      <View>
        <Modal>
          <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
          </View>
        </Modal>
      </View>
    )
  }
```

3. Then simply show it by setting the `isVisible` prop to true:

```javascript
render () {
    return (
      <View>
        <Modal isVisible={true}>
          <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
          </View>
        </Modal>
      </View>
    )
  }
```

The `isVisible` prop is the only prop you'll really need to make the modal work: you should control this prop value by saving it in your state and setting it to `true` or `false` when needed.

## A complete example

The following example consists in a component (`ModalTester`) with a button and a modal.
The modal is controlled by the `isModalVisible` state variable and it is initially hidden, since its value is `false`.  
Pressing the button sets `isModalVisible` to true, making the modal visible.  
Inside the modal there is another button that, when pressed, sets `isModalVisible` to false, hiding the modal.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from "react-native";
import Modal from "react-native-modal";

export default class ModalTester extends Component {
  state = {
    isModalVisible: false
  };

  _toggleModal = () =>
    this.setState({ isModalVisible: !this.state.isModalVisible });

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._toggleModal}>
          <Text>Show Modal</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <Modal isVisible={this.state.isModalVisible}>
          <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            <Text>Hello!</Text>
            <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._toggleModal}>
              <Text>Hide me!</Text>
            </TouchableOpacity>
          </View>
        </Modal>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

For a more complex example take a look at the `/example` directory.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### The component is not working as expected

Under the hood `react-native-modal` uses react-native original [Modal component](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/modal.html).  
Before reporting a bug, try swapping `react-native-modal` with react-native original Modal component and, if the issue persists, check if it has already been reported as a [react-native issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues).

### The backdrop is not completely filled/covered on some Android devices (Galaxy, for one)

Checkout the package [react-native-extra-dimensions-android](https://github.com/Sunhat/react-native-extra-dimensions-android)

To use, here's an example:

```
const IOS = Platform.OS === "ios";
const WIDTH = Dimensions.get("window").width;
const HEIGHT = IOS
  ? Dimensions.get("window").height
  : require("react-native-extra-dimensions-android").get("REAL_WINDOW_HEIGHT");
```

### How can I hide the modal by pressing outside of its content?

The prop `onBackdropPress` allows you to handle this situation:

```javascript
<Modal
  isVisible={this.state.isVisible}
  onBackdropPress={() => this.setState({ isVisible: false })}
>
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
  </View>
</Modal>
```

### How can I hide the modal by swiping it?

The prop `onSwipe` allows you to handle this situation (remember to set `swipeDirection` too!):

```javascript
<Modal
  isVisible={this.state.isVisible}
  onSwipe={() => this.setState({ isVisible: false })}
  swipeDirection="left"
>
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Text>I am the modal content!</Text>
  </View>
</Modal>
```

### The modal flashes in a weird way when animating

Unfortunately this is a [know issue](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-modal/issues/92) that happens when `useNativeDriver=true` and must still be solved.  
In the meanwhile as a workaround you can set the `hideModalContentWhileAnimating` prop to `true`: this seems to solve the issue.
Also, do not assign a `backgroundColor` property directly to the Modal. Prefer to set it on the child container.

### The modal background doesn't animate properly

Are you sure you named the `isVisible` prop correctly? Make sure it is spelled correctly: `isVisible`, not `visible`.

### The modal doesn't change orientation

Add a `supportedOrientations={['portrait', 'landscape']}` prop to the component, as described [in the React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/modal.html#supportedorientations).

## Available animations

Take a look at [react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable) to see the dozens of animations available out-of-the-box. You can also pass in custom animation definitions and have them automatically register with react-native-animatable. For more information on creating custom animations, see the react-native-animatable [animation definition schema](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable#animation-definition-schema).
