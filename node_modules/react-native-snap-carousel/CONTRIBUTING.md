If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it. If you are certain this is a new, unreported bug, you can submit a bug report by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/new).

:warning: When doing so, you need to fill out [the issue template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) completely. **This step is mandatory!** Not doing so will result in your issue getting closed. Don't take this personally if this happens, and feel free to open a new issue once you've gathered all the information required by the template.

* **One issue, one bug:** Please report a single bug per issue.
* **Provide a [Snack example]((https://snack.expo.io/)):** To demonstrate the issue, you need to provide a reduced test case using [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/) and follow [the guidelines for providing a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve). More often than not, providing a screencast will also be of tremendous help to understand the matter at stake (a screenshot might sometimes be enough).
* **Provide reproduction steps:** List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. Provide a Snack, share the relevant source code or upload a sample project to GitHub. We should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.
* **Try out the latest version:** Verify that the issue can be reproduced locally by updating your project to use [the latest commit from `master`](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/TIPS_AND_TRICKS.md#using-a-specific-commit). The bug may have already been fixed! Also make sure to test the latest stable release of React Native as your issue could be linked to RN's core.
